<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>
    JuliaCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
    experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
    expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
    size, race, age, religion, text editor choice, or tabs vs spaces
    preference.  We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
    in any form. Offensive or sexual language and imagery is not
    appropriate for any conference venue, including formal talks and
    networking between sessions. Conference participants violating these
    rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference (without a
    refund) at the discretion of the conference organizers.

    Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li> Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion
      <li> Sexual images in public spaces
      <li> Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
      <li> Harassing photography or recording
      <li> Sustained disruption of talks or other events
      <li> Inappropriate physical contact
      <li> Unwelcome sexual attention
      <li> Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Enforcement</h2>
  <p>
    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
    comply immediately If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
    event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the
    event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes
    warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
    refund. Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed
    to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the
    environment hostile for any participants.  We expect participants to
    follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social
    activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event
    activities too!
  </p>

    report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct
    violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to
